# A.n.D.Visualize

## Overview
### Project description
The project aims to build and create visualization effects of well-known algorithms with multiple configurable options and parameters. Phase 1 of the project focus on fundamental searching algorithms in AI fields. The basic idea of the project comes from an interesting video [2]. Many searching algorithms in this phase might be found in the comprehensive book [1].
